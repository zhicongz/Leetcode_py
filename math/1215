1215. Stepping Numbers

A Stepping Number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1. For example, 321 is a Stepping Number while 421 is not.

Given two integers low and high, find and return a sorted list of all the Stepping Numbers in the range [low, high] inclusive.

Example 1:

Input: low = 0, high = 21
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,21]


```{python}
class Solution:
    def countSteppingNumbers(self, low: int, high: int) -> List[int]:
        res = set()
        def foo(x):
            if x>high:
                return
            if x>=low:
                res.add(x)
            
            d = x%10
            
            if d-1 >=0:
                foo(x*10+d-1)
            if d+1 <=9:
                foo(x*10+d+1)
        
        for i in range(10):
            foo(i)
        
        return(sorted(res))
```
