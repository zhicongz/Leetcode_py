458. Poor Pigs

If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the poisonous bucket within p minutes? There is exactly one bucket with poison.

```
class Solution:
    def poorPigs(self, buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:
        turn = minutesToTest//minutesToDie
        lb,ub = 0,buckets
        while lb<ub:
            temp = (lb+ub)//2
            if (turn+1)**(temp) < buckets:
                lb = temp + 1
            else:
                ub = temp
        return lb
```
Assume there are $t$ turns. For each pig, the results could be treated as a t dim vector. i.e. [live, live,...,die,die...]. Once the status changes to die, it stays in die forever.
Thus, each vector hase t+1 different status combinations. x pigs intotal can generate (t+1)^x different input, to build up a mapping from input to each bucket, (t+1)^x \geq n
