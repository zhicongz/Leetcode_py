1259. Handshakes That Don't Cross

You are given an even number of people num_people that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else, so that there are num_people / 2 handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since this number could be very big, return the answer mod 10^9 + 7

```
class Solution:
    def numberOfWays(self, num_people: int) -> int:
        dp = [1]*(num_people//2+1)
        for i in range(1,num_people//2+1):
            dp[i] = sum(dp[i-j-1]*dp[j] for j in range(i))
        return(dp[-1]%(10**9 + 7))
```
